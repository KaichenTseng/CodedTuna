description: "I've finished the primary structure of my website today using the Go programming language; I'm genuinely astonished at how small yet helpful it is; the outcome is better than the previous portfolio I built a few months ago. Still finishing the remainder of the website at the moment; for the time being, the categories, search, posts and tags are complete and ready for use; I'll schedule time to do the rest and resolve any issues; if you notice any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me via the links! Thanks."
